The XiiSBar is a small portable Sensor Bar. It is useful to fully use the WiiMote on your portable Wii. 

Its small form factor means that you can put it under a Xii-Boy Pocket stand !

## Assembly
<img src="images/parts.png" width= "780" />
This is all the parts you need to build a XiiSBar. 
All the STLs for the 3D printed parts are in the STL folder.

The XiiSBar PCB files are available in the PCB folder. All the components are listed in the "BOM.pdf" file üòâ

First, put the switch slider in the switch hole of the case. Then, rotate the board in place.

‚ö† This last part could be a bit tricky considering the small tolerances ‚ö†

After that, you'll need to screew the board in place. Use the M1.7x4 ones.

Place this piece as shown below and then fold it. Do the same thing for the other black piece.

‚ö† If you deceided to solder the optional LED2, you have to use the "Right + LED" piece instead. ‚ö†

Now, take this piece and place it like this. You should be able to close the case.

Take two M1.7x6 screws and screw the case.

Finally, take the battery cover and the clip. Put both parts together.‚ö† You might need some super glue ‚ö†

Finally, put the battery cover on the case and close it ! That's it !

If you have any question during the assembly, about the files or other, don't hesistate to ask me üëç
