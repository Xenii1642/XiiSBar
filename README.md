This is all the pieces you need to build a XiiSBar. 
All the STL for the 3D printed parts are in the STL folder.

The XiiSBar PCB files are available in the PCB folder. All the components are listed in the "BOM.pdf" file ðŸ˜‰

First, put switch slider in the switch hole of the case. Then, rotate the board in place.

After that, you'll need to screew the board in place. Use the M1.7x4 ones.

Place this piece as shown and then fold it. Do the same thing for the other black piece.
